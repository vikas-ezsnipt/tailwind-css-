## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without the need to write custom CSS. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide, from installation and configuration to building reusable components and mastering advanced techniques.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tailwindcss-guide.git
   cd tailwindcss-guide
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Basic Concepts

Tailwind is built around utility classes that allow you to design directly in your HTML files.

- **Spacing**: Easily add margin and padding using classes like `m-4`, `p-6`, etc.
- **Colors**: Tailwind offers a full palette of colors like `bg-blue-500`, `text-gray-800`.
- **Typography**: Use classes like `text-xl`, `font-bold`, and more to control text styling.
  
Check out the `/src` folder for basic examples of how to use these utilities in a real project.

## Responsive Design

Tailwind enables you to build responsive layouts with ease by using responsive prefixes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:`.

Example:
```html
<div class="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
  Responsive text based on screen size
</div>
```

## Components

Here are examples of essential components you can build using Tailwind CSS.

### Landing Page

A simple landing page example is provided in the `/src/components/landing-page.html` file.

### Navbar

Find the responsive navbar component in `/src/components/navbar.html`.

### Card

A reusable card component is available in `/src/components/card.html`.

## Advanced Features

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is configured in this repository, allowing you to toggle between light and dark themes. Check out the `dark:` prefix in action.

### Animations

Tailwind includes utility classes for basic animations, such as `animate-spin`, `animate-ping`, etc.

## Customization

To customize your Tailwind setup, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can extend default configurations by adding custom colors, fonts, spacing values, and more.

Example:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        customBlue: '#1E3A8A',
      },
    },
  },
}
```
